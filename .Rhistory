Adherent cells can adapt their cytoskeleton in response to elastic properties modifications in the extracellular matrix. This kind of cell, has an anchorage-dependency and is usually cultivate in a suitable substrate that provides specific conditions to the cells growth and spread. In the context of the animal cells, they can have different water composition and be able to growth better in some substrates. This properties are going to conduce the better technique to prepare the samples for x-ray microscopy data acquisition. See below the most common sample preparations in this way.

abstract = {Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have been extensively used for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications due to their ease of isolation and expansion and their ability to differentiate towards various lineages of mesodermal origin. Despite these properties, their clinical potential is often hampered by the simplicity of the in vitro environment and its inability to resemble the complex in vivo niche. Herein, different microenvironmental cues (e.g. surface topography, substrate stiffness, mechanical stimulation, oxygen tension and coculture systems) that have been utilized to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are discussed.},

**Biological material.** It's necessary be careful to the kind of cell used in the study. Working in sterile conditions and biological security prevents the contamination of the cell line, but is specially important when the sample is intrinsically contaminated (infected cells, for example). For this, all the good biosafety practices should be follow: working in flow hood (clean and sterile with UV lamp), lab gloves, lab coat, and others Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), sterile material (glassware, lab accessories). Then, when the procedures with sample *in vivo* happened it is need to have an inactivation step. In a general way the chemical fixation already allows the inactivation of the sample.\cite{Tsiapalis2019}

Imaging is the oldest application of X-rays since their discovery. The edge-enhancement effect is one of the key features of synchrotron imaging because it improves the sensitivity of imaging structures with only small density differences and absorption contrast.Compared with the laboratory-based X-ray sources, synchrotrons have the advantages of a wide energy range, a high photon flux, and good beam coherence. As a result this advantages permits faster acquisition of a large range of samples with different phase techniques e.g. X-ray nanoscopy or Coherent and Time-resolsed X-ray Scattering. [@Westneat2008]
