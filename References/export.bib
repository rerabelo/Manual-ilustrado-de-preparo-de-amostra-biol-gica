   abstract = {Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells have been extensively used for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications due to their ease of isolation and expansion and their ability to differentiate towards various lineages of mesodermal origin. Despite these properties, their clinical potential is often hampered by the simplicity of the in vitro environment and its inability to resemble the complex in vivo niche. Herein, different microenvironmental cues (e.g. surface topography, substrate stiffness, mechanical stimulation, oxygen tension and coculture systems) that have been utilized to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells are discussed.},
